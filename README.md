## ovflowd's personal dotfiles

This repository includes ovflowd's personal dotfiles.

### Before starting

- **ZSH**. We use ZSH. Remember to install ZSH before, or `chsh -s /bin/zsh`
- The `install.script` is compatible with Fedora, Debian and MacOS
- This script will overwrite existing Bash Profile, ZSH and Oh-My-ZSH environments.

#### Note for VS/GitHub CodeSpace Users

- Please install the [Hack Nerd Font](https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack) on your system. This is required for PowerLevel10K. Otherwise Terminal will have broken icons.
- Don't forget to change the font on `Settings > Features > Terminal > Integrated: Font Family` to `'Hack Nerd Font'`.
